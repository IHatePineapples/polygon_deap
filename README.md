## Overview

A famous digital artists, Leonardo Dali da Vallejo, got his hi-tech computer destroyed by a neutrino beam. He ordered a new one, but due to shortage of graphics cards on the market, the estimated delivery time is months away. And he has work to do. Customers from all over the world ordered his paintings for birthdays, weddings, and other special occasions. He cannot disappoint them! His reputation is at stake! So he went down to the basement to look for his trusty Commodore 64, which he used to make art in the '80.

As it has been a while, Leonardo has forgotten how little memory his old machine has. He is used to creating complicated vector art with millions of polygons, and was quite shocked to find that the old computer cannot handle more than 100 polygons. His art needs to be very carefully planned, every polygon matters! And this is where he needs your help...
Task

## Details
Given a target image (badly) drawn by Leonardo by hand, creates its faithful digital representation using no more than 100 semi-transparent polygons.

Using evolutionary algorithms (Python modules: [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.org/) (Links to an external site.)) to achieve good results. There are many possible approaches to this problem, and it is unclear which will work best. Therefore, experimentation is needed.
